<h2>Workshop Week 11</h2>

<p>In this week's workshop, we will discuss a few questions that are related to OWL 2 DL (description logics) and rule languages. 
  Additionally, you will use the Answer Set Programming tool <i>clingo</i> to reconstruct a rule-based program that we discussed
  in the lecture.</p>

<h4>Your Tasks</h4>

<h4>OWL 2 and Rule Languages</h4>

<ol>
  <li>First-order logic as well as description logics are knowledge representation languages. Why did the W3C choose 
      description logics and not first-order logic as the logical foundation for the Web Ontology Language OWL 2?</li><br>

  <li>Explain what the difference between an ABox and a TBox in an ontology is and provide two
      ABox statements and two TBox statements.</li><br>

  <li>OWL 2 DL is based on a version of description logics and supports three different profiles.
      What are these profiles good for and what kind of problems do they solve?</li><br>

  <li>Why didn't the W3C develop a standard for rule languages so far? What does the Rule Interchange Format (RIF) try to achieve?</li><br>

  <li>Explain the differences between a declarative rule and a production rule.</li><br>

  <li>Explain why the Semantic Web should be able to deal with non-monotonic rules and provide 
    an example of a non-monotonic rule.</li><br>

  <li>Statistical relational learning combines rules with probabilities. Below is a logic program with annotated disjunctions that
      represents the following gambling problem:  Toss a coin and draw a ball from each of two urns. The first urn contains three
      red and seven blue balls; the second urn two red, three green and five blue balls.
    
<pre>
heads:0.4.
col(1, red):0.3 ; col(1, blue):0.7.
col(2, red):0.2 ; col(2, green):0.3 ; col(2,blue):0.5.
win :- heads, col(_, red).
win :- col(1, C), col(2, C).
</pre>

    <p>Answer the following questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the probability of the most probable world where <font face="courrier">win</font> is true?</li>
      <li>What is the probability of <font face="courrier">win</font>?</li>
      <li>What is the probability of <font face="courrier">win</font> given  <font face="courrier">col(2, green)</font>?</li>
    </ol>

  </li><br>

</ol>


<h4>Answer Set Programming</h4>

<p>Answer Set Programming is a form of declarative programming and has its roots in logic programming, 
  deductive databases and non-monotonic reasoning. <a href="https://potassco.org/clingo/">Clingo</a>
  is a tool that generates answer sets for an ASP program.</p>

<p>Install clingo using the Anaconada prompt and then run: <font face="courrier">conda install -c potassco clingo</font> .</p>

<p>Afterwards, execute the following ASP program:</p> 

<pre>% -----------------------------------------
% COMP3220

% Answer Set Programming
% Working with Rules and Facts
% -----------------------------------------

wine_bottle(brand1).   
wine_bottle(brand2). 
wine_bottle(brand3).    
wine_bottle(brand4).    
wine_bottle(brand5). 

type(brand1, whiteWine).
type(brand1, sweetWine).    
type(brand2, whiteWine).
type(brand2, dryWine). 
type(brand3, whiteWine).   
type(brand3, dryWine).
type(brand4, redWine). 
type(brand4, dryWine).      
type(brand5, redWine).    
type(brand5, sweetWine).

person(john).
person(mary).
person(sue).

has_preference(john,  whiteWine).
has_preference(mary, redWine).
has_preference(sue,   dryWine).

is_suitable_for(Brand, Person) :-  
  has_preference(Person, Sort), 
  type(Brand, Sort). 

#show is_suitable_for/2.  

</pre>

In order to do this, you copy this ASP program into a text file (for example, asp.lp).

Next, you run clingo as follows:

<pre>   &gt;clingo 0 asp.lp

</pre>

This will generate the following output:
<pre>clingo version 5.5.0
Reading from asp.lp

Answer: 1
is_suitable_for(brand1,john)
is_suitable_for(brand2,john) 
is_suitable_for(brand3,john)
is_suitable_for(brand4,mary) 
is_suitable_for(brand5,mary) 
is_suitable_for(brand2,sue) 
is_suitable_for(brand3,sue) 
is_suitable_for(brand4,sue)
SATISFIABLE

Models       : 1
Calls        : 1
Time         : 0.000s (Solving: 0.00s 1st Model: 0.00s Unsat: 0.00s)
CPU Time     : 0.000s

</pre>

<p>Now do the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li> Add a rule that generates the Closed World Assumption for the literal has_preference/2.</li><br>
<li> Add a rule for: If a brand is suitable for a person then the person selects that brand or skips it.</li><br>
<li> Add a rule for: Exclude that a person selects more than one brand.</li><br>
<li> Add a rule for: Include only those answer sets where three persons select a brand.</li><br>
<li> Add a rule for: If brand 4 would be suitable for a person then that person actually skips brand 4.</li><br>
<li> Add a rule for: If brand 2 would be suitable for a person then that person actually skips brand 2.</li><br>
<li> Add a (negated) fact for: John does not select brand 3.</li>
</ol>


<p>How to do this, you can find in detail in the <strong>lecture notes</strong> (Week 11: Rule Languages). 
After adding a rule to your program, run the ASP solver again and observe what happens. You can selectively display, 
a particular literal you are interested in by adding the following directives to your ASP program:</p>

<pre>  #show is_suitable_for/2.
  #show -has_preference/2.
  #show selects/2.

</pre>

and use '%' if you do not want to see one or more of these literals in the output:

<pre>  % #show is_suitable_for/2.
  % #show -has_preference/2.
  #show selects/2.

</pre>

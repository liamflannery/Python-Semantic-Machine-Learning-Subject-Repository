43510,2442,30,Which genes belong to the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors in plants?,the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development.,0,43510
43511,2442,31,Which genes belong to the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors in plants?,a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil.,0,43511
43512,2442,32,Which genes belong to the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors in plants?,auxin mediates numerous plant responses some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation one auxin response pathway which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression is mediated by tir1 transport inhibitor response protein 1 tir1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an scf type ubiquitin ligase in the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus members of the aux iaa family of transcriptional repressors bind to arf proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to tir1 causing the aux iaa proteins to associate with tir1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome mediated pathway this decreases the concentration of aux iaa proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes.,0,43512
43513,2442,33,Which genes belong to the AUX/IAA family of transcription repressors in plants?,recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins the auxin aux response factors arfs the aux iaas and the f box protein tir1 the arf proteins bind dna and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the aux iaa proteins repress arf function tir1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of aux iaa proteins here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of arabidopsis called axr5 1 mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms further the axr5 1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin regulated transcription the molecular cloning of axr5 revealed that the gene encodes the iaa1 protein a member of the aux iaa family of proteins axr5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype the axr5 1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain ii of the protein similar to gain of function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family biochemical studies show that iaa1 axr5 interacts with tir1 in an auxin dependent manner the mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of iaa1 axr5 our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the aux iaa family are targeted for degradation by scftir1 in response to auxin.,0,43513
